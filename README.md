## Description

This is a website that works somewhat like a linktree of my projects that I find somewhat cool.

## Security

This website was also an occasion for me to learn more about mobile scaling, 
making the website accessible and load fast.

Check out the `/src/csp/index.ts` and `/next.config.js` to see how to make
a Nextjs application (like this personal website) a PWA and score high 
on Mozilla Observatory!
